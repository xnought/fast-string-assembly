## Insights
- Single string assembly index is $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil$
- Max outer loops (global time) for string assembly is also $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil$
- If you keep track of the index at each string, you can backtrack from $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil - 1$ since you know automatically that the last will combine + 1 to get the solution. I wonder if you could recursively apply this to somehow save a shit ton of computation?
- If you constrain the possible assemblies to be a substring of the end result, it drastically reduces computation.  By how much? Not sure. 
- Guess: Applying monte carlo search or heuristics leads to wrong solutions, but approximately good.
- there could be other ways to constrain the possibilities and still get accurate results? There also may be heuristics that don't mess with the final result. 
- I could either backtrack the results or I could construct a graph and the objects contain a node instead of the combined string. The memory savings would be BIG though. 
- Backtracking idea if low on memory
	- Compute up to $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil - 1$ and keep track of current best assembly index for each object
	- Find the two smallest objects that combine to get the result at $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil$
	- This will recover a+b->c where c is the end result. Repeat this by subtract 1 to recover the entire tree.
- If low on compute
	- Add a node and its assembly index
	- When you combine nodes, point to the nodes and sum their assembly index + 1
	- Stop at $\lceil \log_2(n) \rceil - 1$ and do backtracking just for one layer to recover the last connection
- Idea: forward in one thread, backtrack in another, do monte-carlo search in both directions.

## Paper

So there are two contributions to be had I see. Should they be two separate papers or not?

1. The small learnings about how to speed up assembly computation while keeping end result correct.
2. Way to visualize the assembly with Mycelium

I would say the second is not really a contribution, but a good way to create and show figures.
